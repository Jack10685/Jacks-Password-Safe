# Jacks-Password-Safe
Password Manager written in Java

Uses twice-encrypted SHA-256 encryption for the pin/passcode to the application, uses Jasypt 1.9.0 (http://www.jasypt.org/) for all other encryption (PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES).

Use, modify, and distribute however you want, I just ask for credit for building the "base" code.
